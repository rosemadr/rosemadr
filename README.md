## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Madi (she/they)
---
A former publisher and Literature and Philosophy MA grad turned Software Engineer. You can see my very first coding attempts (of a literary bent of course!) saved for posterity in my will-compare repository â€“ a project to compare versions of Hamlet.

I have now been a SWE for 3+ years. I have a mixed technical background, having original trained in Java, spent significant time doing data engineering, am now doing a Full-Stack role. I love learning new technologies and getting stuck in to the problem at hand.

I am passionate about Sustainable Software Engineering and delivered a talk on the topic ("From Clean Code to Green Code") at JAX New York conference in October 2024.

For a good example of my Java and Spring Boot skills check out my end of bootcamp project a [library API](https://github.com/rosemadr/DFESW7_Final_Project).
 * practicing my Java skills (see pinned repos for current work!)
* building my Linux and command line knowledge using the [overthewire games](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)<br>
